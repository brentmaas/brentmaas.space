<p>The entire history of a star, from its birth to its eventual death, is a long and complex process that takes places over a huge difference in both time and space. Nevertheless, I want to find out how feasible it is to start out with a molecular cloud and how far into the lifetime of a star one can come before such a simulation breaks down.</p>
<p>More details will follow later.</p>
